## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark, almost black background (#121212) provides a stark contrast.
- Primary color:  Deep teal blue (#00796B) that is engaging, especially against the dark background.
- Accent color: Bright Yellow (#FFDA63) to draw attention to key interactive elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, neutral feel. Inter is a sans-serif font that is easily readable, which is great for longer text.
